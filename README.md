# Support-Vector-Machines

In this project we use the built-in dataset which is available in Sckit-learn and Seaborn library.

 # SVM
 
    -->This model gives the better optimization by adjusting the parameters using the GRID SEARCH CV.
       Here CV means Cross Validation
       
    -->If suppose we are unable to draw optimal hyperplane.It's neccessary to use KERNEL to convert 1-D view of data to 2-D view.
    
    -->It allows us to operate in the original feature space without computing the coordinates of the data in a higher dimensional space.
